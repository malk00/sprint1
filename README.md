Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for our team’s sprint project focused on identifying strategic growth opportunities for Wealthsimple by analyzing 104,000+ CFPB consumer finance complaints (2021–2025).
Our goal was to uncover where traditional financial institutions consistently fail and how Wealthsimple can differentiate by design.

The project includes:

A cleaned Jupyter Notebook used for data exploration and preliminary analysis

An Executive Summary outlining actionable business insights

A Presentation Deck highlighting key findings and recommendations

Objective

How might Wealthsimple differentiate itself from traditional financial institutions by addressing common customer complaints?

To answer this, we:

Processed and cleaned a large complaint dataset (~7GB)

Identified recurring pain points (fees, response delays, account access issues, customer service failures, etc.)

Mapped these gaps to Wealthsimple’s existing strengths and potential product improvements

Prioritized opportunities that align with Wealthsimple’s growth trajectory

Key Insights

Traditional banks struggle most with resolution time, transparency, and customer support.

Digital-first players (like Wealthsimple) outperform in User experience but still have whitespace in customer service reliability and product clarity.

Complaints often cluster around transparency, money transfer, mortgages, and account issues, exposing the fragmentation in traditional finance.

Wealthsimple can win share by delivering faster resolution loops, clearer communication, and proactive customer support automation.
